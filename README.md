# android-stopwatch
My first android app, replicating the default stopwatch that comes on any Android phone <br>
I realized a timer might be too overwhelming for a first app. <br> <br>

Tutorial followed : http://examples.javacodegeeks.com/android/core/os/handler/android-timer-example/ <br>
Android app creation through Android Studio

# v1.2
* BUG, layout of buttons and text implementation needs to be changed such that it adapts depending on screen size
* I did a bit of experimentation with a wallpaper in the background but a bug prevented the wallpaper from showing, therefore the wallpaper did not get implemented
* Added and implemented a "RESET" button
* Added a second significant digit to the minutes value
* Modified some text sizes and button sizes
* The buttons are enabled and disabled depending on the situation to prevent any bugs while using the stopwatch
* The buttons that are disabled now have greyed out text for better user interaction <br>
